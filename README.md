# Compiler Project

## Description

This project involves the development of a mini-compiler for a custom language. The compiler covers key elements such as:
- Lexical analysis using **FLEX**
- Syntax-directed translation using **Bison**
- Symbol table management for variables and constants
- Error handling for lexical, syntactic, and semantic errors

The compiler processes variable declarations, constants, control structures, and more, ensuring a smooth compilation process.

For a detailed description of the language structure, variable declarations, and compilation phases, please refer to the **Compiler Description** file included in the project.

## Key Features
- Variable and constant declarations
- Basic and nested control structures (e.g., loops, conditions)
- Error reporting with line and column numbers
- Intermediate code generation in quadruplet form

## Tools Used
- **FLEX**: For lexical analysis
- **Bison**: For syntax-directed translation
- **C language**: For symbol table management and error handling

For more information, please see the **Compiler Description** file.
